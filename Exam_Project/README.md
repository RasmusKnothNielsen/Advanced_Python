# Path finding visualizer


## What is this project?
This is a pathfinding program that implements three different algorithms to find a path from a to b.

Implemented algorithms:
- Breadth First
- Dijkstra's
- A*

## How to use project?
Install libraries

> $ pip install colorama

Remember to run it from the terminal / Commandprompt

> $ python pathfinder.py  

or

> $ python3 pathfinder.py  

depending on how you have set up your path variables.

## How to change settings?
Alterations of the starting point, ending point and maze can be done  
by altering the respective values from line 367 to line 395  

Furthermore, you can choose which algorithms you want to see solve each maze,  
by commenting out each method call on line 397 to line 399
