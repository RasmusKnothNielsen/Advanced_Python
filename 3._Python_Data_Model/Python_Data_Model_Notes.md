# Python Data Model

A paradigm to follow, so that we utilize the implemented dunder methods in python.

like:
> __len__()

> __getItem__()

> __str__()



###__str__ vs __repr__

> __str__

Returns a string representation of the object it is called upon

> __repr__

Returns a string representation that is parsed as an actual object of the same type as the object it 
is called upon.
